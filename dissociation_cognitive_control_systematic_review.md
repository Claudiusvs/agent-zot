# Systematic Review: The Relationship Between Dissociation and Cognitive Control

## Executive Summary

This systematic review synthesizes current research on the complex relationship between dissociation and cognitive control mechanisms. Analysis of the literature reveals a nuanced picture: while dissociative experiences are generally associated with cognitive control deficits in clinical populations, enhanced performance in specific cognitive domains has been observed in non-clinical populations with trait dissociation. Key neural mechanisms involve alterations in prefrontal cortex activation, particularly dorsomedial and dorsolateral regions, along with changes in cingulate, parietal, and subcortical structures. The evidence supports multiple theoretical frameworks, with disrupted integration of cognitive functions and altered attentional control emerging as central mechanisms.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Dissociation represents a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior (Spiegel et al., 2013). These experiences range from common, non-pathological forms in the general population to severe, debilitating symptoms in dissociative disorders. Understanding how dissociation relates to cognitive control—the ability to override prepotent responses, maintain focus, and flexibly adapt behavior—is crucial for both theoretical models and clinical interventions.

### 1.2 Scope and Objectives

This review aims to:
1. Synthesize theoretical frameworks linking dissociation and cognitive control
2. Evaluate empirical evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies
3. Compare findings across clinical and non-clinical populations
4. Identify methodological approaches and their limitations
5. Highlight research gaps and future directions

## 2. Theoretical Frameworks

### 2.1 Competing Models of Dissociation

Two primary models dominate the field:

**Trauma Model (TM)**: Conceptualizes dissociation as an automatic defensive response to unbearable psychic pain, serving as emotional escape from trauma (Dalenberg et al., 2012). This model emphasizes dissociation as a phylogenetically important response that enhances survival through automatization of behavior, analgesia, and isolation of catastrophic experiences.

**Sociocognitive Model (SCM)**: Emphasizes social and cognitive variables including fantasy-proneness, suggestibility, cognitive failures, and media influences (Lynn et al., 2019). This perspective views dissociation through a broader lens of cognitive and cultural determinants.

### 2.2 Cognitive Control Mechanisms in Dissociation

#### 2.2.1 Attentional Control Theory
Dissociation is theorized to involve fundamental changes in attentional control (DePrince & Freyd, 1999; Carleton et al., 2010). Children may cope with trauma by shifting attention away from abuse to other experiences, real or imagined. This mechanism aligns with evidence that high-intensity negative stimuli lead to emotional regulation via attention shifting (Sheppes et al., 2011).

#### 2.2.2 Disrupted Integration Theory
Dissociation represents a disruption of psychological function integration, particularly affecting perception and attention (Dell & O'Neil, 2009). This disruption may facilitate coping with traumatic stress but results in fragmented cognitive processing.

#### 2.2.3 Meta-Consciousness and Self-Regulation Framework
Recent transtheoretical approaches propose dissociation involves impaired meta-consciousness and self-regulatory deficits (Lynn et al., 2019). This includes:
- Deficits in identifying and elaborating emotions
- Impaired source memory
- Problems regulating memories and thoughts
- Reduced ability to implement emotion regulation strategies

## 3. Empirical Findings

### 3.1 Cognitive Performance in Non-Clinical Populations

#### 3.1.1 Executive Function Deficits
In healthy individuals with high trait dissociation:
- **Impaired performance** on executive functioning tasks (Amrhein et al., 2008; Giesbrecht et al., 2004)
- **Reduced divided attention** capacity (Olsen & Beck, 2012)
- **Verbal memory deficits** (Amrhein et al., 2008; Devilly et al., 2007)
- **Working memory impairments** (Amrhein et al., 2008)
- **Greater self-reported executive function difficulties** (Bruce et al., 2007)

#### 3.1.2 Enhanced Performance Paradox
Paradoxically, some studies report enhanced cognitive abilities:
- **Superior working memory performance** in high dissociators under specific conditions (de Ruiter et al., 2006)
- **Better verbal working memory** task performance in students with high trait dissociation (Elzinga et al., 2007)
- Evidence suggests dissociation may reflect a cognitive capacity rather than pure dysfunction in non-pathological forms

### 3.2 Clinical Populations

#### 3.2.1 Dissociative Disorders
Patients with dissociative disorders show:
- **Enhanced working memory performance** with increased activation in left anterior PFC, left DLPFC, and left parietal lobe (Elzinga et al., 2007)
- **Smaller decline in performance** with increasing cognitive load compared to controls
- **Alterations in inhibitory control** particularly when anxiety is present (Dorahy et al., 2006)

#### 3.2.2 PTSD with Dissociative Subtype
McKinnon et al. (2016) comprehensive review found:
- Consistent associations between dissociation severity and cognitive dysfunction
- Impairments in memory, attention, and executive functioning
- Greater cognitive dysfunction predicts poorer treatment response

#### 3.2.3 Borderline Personality Disorder
Patients with BPD and dissociative symptoms demonstrate:
- Significant neuropsychological dysfunction correlating with dissociation severity
- Impaired cognitive control particularly during emotional processing

### 3.3 Neuroimaging Findings

#### 3.3.1 Structural Alterations
Systematic review by Lotfinia et al. (2020) identified:
- **Decreased volumes**: Hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus
- **Alterations across**: Temporal and frontal cortices, limbic system, brainstem

#### 3.3.2 Functional Alterations
Biomarker review by Roydeva & Reinders (2021) identified key neurofunctional markers:

**Hyperactivation in**:
- Dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
- Bilateral superior frontal regions
- Anterior cingulate cortex
- Posterior parietal association areas
- Basal ganglia

**Functional connectivity changes**:
- Disrupted frontoparietal network connectivity
- Altered default mode network function
- Changes in salience network activation

#### 3.3.3 Task-Related Activation Patterns
During cognitive tasks, dissociative patients show:
- **Increased PFC activation** during working memory tasks despite better performance
- **Altered inhibitory control networks** particularly right fronto-parietal regions
- **Compensatory hyperactivation** suggesting inefficient neural processing

## 4. Psychological Mechanisms: Network Analysis Findings

Recent network analysis by Černis et al. (2022) with 6,161 participants revealed:

### 4.1 Directly Connected Mechanisms
Six psychological processes showed direct connections to dissociation:
1. **Cognitive appraisals** (strongest connection, causal effect 0.73)
2. **Behavioral responses to dissociation**
3. **Perseverative thinking**
4. **Alexithymia** (negative correlation - surprising finding)
5. **General self-efficacy** (low self-efficacy linked to dissociation)
6. **Beliefs about being overwhelmed**

### 4.2 Indirect Pathways
- **Affect intolerance** influences dissociation through cognitive appraisals
- **Attentional control deficits** operate through rumination and appraisals
- **Low self-efficacy** acts via increased negative appraisals and rumination

## 5. Methodological Considerations

### 5.1 Study Designs
- **Cross-sectional studies** dominate the literature
- **Limited longitudinal research** on developmental trajectories
- **Few experimental manipulation studies** of dissociation states

### 5.2 Measurement Approaches
- **Self-report measures**: DES, DES-II, Cambridge Depersonalization Scale
- **Cognitive tasks**: N-back, Stroop, directed forgetting paradigms
- **Neuroimaging**: fMRI, structural MRI, DTI
- **Psychophysiological**: Heart rate variability, skin conductance (inconclusive)

### 5.3 Sample Characteristics
- **Sample sizes**: Range from small clinical samples (n=13-30) to large population studies (n=6,000+)
- **Populations studied**: University students, clinical patients, military personnel, general population
- **Limited diversity** in ethnic and cultural backgrounds

## 6. Key Contradictions and Debates

### 6.1 The Enhancement vs. Impairment Paradox
- Non-clinical dissociation sometimes associated with cognitive enhancement
- Clinical dissociation consistently linked to impairment
- May reflect different subtypes or severity continuum

### 6.2 Alexithymia Findings
- Traditional view: Positive correlation between alexithymia and dissociation
- Recent network analysis: Negative correlation, suggesting heightened emotional awareness
- May depend on dissociation conceptualization (FSA vs. other forms)

### 6.3 Causality Questions
- Does cognitive dysfunction cause dissociation or vice versa?
- Are both consequences of trauma or stress?
- Limited evidence for causal directions

## 7. Clinical Implications

### 7.1 Assessment Recommendations
- Include cognitive assessment in dissociative disorder evaluations
- Screen for dissociation in patients with unexplained cognitive complaints
- Consider dissociation severity when interpreting neuropsychological results

### 7.2 Treatment Considerations
- Cognitive remediation may benefit patients with dissociation
- Attention training and metacognitive interventions show promise
- Treatment must account for cognitive limitations affecting engagement

### 7.3 Biomarker Potential
Emerging biomarkers for clinical use:
- **Neuroimaging**: DLPFC and DMPFC activation patterns
- **Psychobiological**: Oxytocin, prolactin, TNF-α levels
- **Cognitive profiles**: Working memory-attention dissociation patterns

## 8. Research Gaps and Future Directions

- Experience sampling methods
- Virtual reality paradigms

### 8.3 Theoretical Integration

Future models should integrate:
- Trauma and sociocognitive perspectives
- Neurobiological and psychological levels of analysis
- State and trait aspects of dissociation
- Cultural and contextual factors

## 9. Conclusions

The relationship between dissociation and cognitive control is complex and multifaceted. Evidence consistently shows alterations in cognitive control associated with dissociation, though the nature of these alterations varies by population, severity, and context. In clinical populations, dissociation is generally associated with cognitive impairments that affect treatment engagement and outcomes. However, non-pathological dissociation in healthy individuals sometimes correlates with enhanced performance in specific domains, suggesting potential adaptive aspects.

Neuroimaging reveals consistent patterns of altered prefrontal activation and connectivity, particularly in dorsomedial and dorsolateral regions, providing potential biomarkers for clinical application. The strongest psychological mechanism appears to be cognitive appraisals of dissociative experiences, with multiple pathways involving affect regulation, self-efficacy, and attentional control.

Critical gaps remain in understanding causality, developmental trajectories, and optimal interventions. Future research should prioritize longitudinal designs, experimental manipulations, and integration of multiple theoretical perspectives. Clinical practice should incorporate cognitive assessment in dissociative presentations and consider cognitive factors in treatment planning.
