# Research Workflow Guide

This guide demonstrates common research workflows using Agent-Zot's advanced query capabilities.

## üÜï Recommended: Intelligent Unified Tools

**As of October 2025**, use these intelligent tools for most research workflows:

### `zot_search` - Finding Papers
The **recommended default** for literature discovery. Automatically:
- Detects query intent (relationship/metadata/semantic)
- Selects optimal backend combination
- Expands vague queries
- Escalates when quality is inadequate

### `zot_summarize` - Understanding Papers
The **recommended default** for paper analysis. Automatically:
- Detects desired depth (quick/targeted/comprehensive/full)
- Optimizes cost (prevents unnecessary full-text extraction)
- Orchestrates multi-aspect summaries
- Returns 4 key aspects: research question, methodology, findings, conclusions

**Complete Workflow Example:**
```
1. zot_search("neural mechanisms of cognitive control") ‚Üí Find relevant papers
2. zot_summarize(item_key, "Summarize comprehensively") ‚Üí Understand each paper
3. [Use specialized tools below for deeper analysis]
```

**Use specialized tools** (listed below) for specific graph analysis tasks like citation networks, concept evolution, and collaboration analysis.

## Query Patterns Reference

### Semantic Search Patterns

**Best for**: Finding papers by meaning, topic, or abstract concepts

```
‚úÖ Good queries:
- "Papers about self-supervised learning for vision"
- "Work on scaling laws for neural networks"
- "Research combining graphs and attention"

‚ùå Less effective:
- "Paper by Smith" (use metadata search instead)
- "Papers from 2023" (use recent developments instead)
```

---

### Graph Search Patterns

**Best for**: Finding relationships, networks, and connections

```
‚úÖ Good queries:
- "Papers citing papers that cite attention mechanisms"
- "Collaborators of collaborators of Hinton"
- "Concepts related to transformers through 2 hops"
- "Find seminal papers in my library"

‚ùå Less effective:
- "Papers about X" (use semantic search)
- "Recent papers" (use temporal filtering)
```

---

### Hybrid Search Patterns

**Best for**: Combining semantic meaning with graph relationships

```
‚úÖ Good queries:
- "Papers semantically similar to KEY with shared authors"
- "Recent work (2 years) on topic X with graph connections"
- "Papers discussing [Concept] by [Author's] network"
```

---

### Temporal Patterns

**Best for**: Time-based analysis and recent developments

```
‚úÖ Good queries:
- "Recent developments on diffusion models (last 2 years)"
- "Track how LLMs evolved from 2018-2025"
- "Papers from 2024 on AI safety"

üí° Tip: Combine with semantic or graph search for powerful queries
```

## Tips for Effective Research

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with semantic search or seminal papers, then use graph tools to explore relationships.

### 2. Leverage Multi-Hop Queries

2-3 hop traversals reveal non-obvious connections. Start with 2 hops, increase if needed.

### 3. Combine Tools

Most powerful workflows use 3-4 different tools in sequence.

### 4. Use Temporal Filters

Always check recent developments (last 1-2 years) to understand current state.

### 5. Follow the Citation Chain

Highly-cited papers ‚Üí citation chains ‚Üí recent papers citing them = complete picture.

### 6. Verify with Semantic Search

After graph queries, use semantic search to find additional papers that might not be in the graph yet.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Use graph search for broad topical queries (use semantic search)
- Ignore temporal dimensions (research moves fast!)
- Stop after finding 1 seminal paper (there are usually several)
- Forget to explore related concepts (they reveal adjacent opportunities)

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Combine multiple query types for comprehensive coverage
- Track evolution over time to understand trends
- Explore 2-3 hops for non-obvious connections
- Use both semantic and graph approaches
- Check recent developments after historical analysis
